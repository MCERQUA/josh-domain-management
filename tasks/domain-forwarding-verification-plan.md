## Next Steps

1. Verify all existing forwarding configurations (marked with [x]) to ensure they are working correctly
2. Set up forwarding for all domains marked with [ ] to their appropriate main domain 
3. Record all update dates in the Airtable database after configuring the redirects
4. Focus development efforts on the main domains that are not yet live
