## Discrepancy Note
There appears to be a discrepancy between our checklist data and the actual site. The checklist indicated this was an "active" site with Vercel hosting, but we found it's actually a parked domain at GoDaddy. Further investigation is needed to determine if:

1. The site was recently taken down
2. There was a DNS configuration change
3. The domain information in our database is outdated
4. There is another primary domain being used instead

## Related Domain Note
We discovered that virtualinsuranceagent.io is active and redirects to contractorschoiceagency.com (without "the" prefix). This suggests the business may be using the shorter domain name instead of thecontractorschoiceagency.com.
