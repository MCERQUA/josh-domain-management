## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to systematically document all 553 domains in Josh's portfolio and add them to a Pinecone vector database for knowledge management. We are prioritizing insurance-related domains first, followed by other categories.

Each domain will be visited, analyzed, and documented according to our standardized template.
